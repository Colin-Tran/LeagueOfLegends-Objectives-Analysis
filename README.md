# League of Legends Analysis: A look into Objective Control and Match Outcomes

## Introduction
League of Legends (LoL / LOL) is a wildly popular multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game that was released in October 2009 by Riot Games. Since its release, it has grown into one of the largest video games in the world with millions of total players. With its growth has come multiple professional leagues worldwide, blooming the League of Legends Esports scene into one of the largest and most competitive esports ecosystems in the world.

Within League of Legends itself there is so much capturable in game data. Each game produces detailed statistics such as kills, gold earned, vision control, early-game advantages, objective control, and overall match outcomes. The dataset used in this project comes from Oracle’s Elixir, a widely used public source for professional League of Legends statistics. Specifically, this analysis focuses on data from the 2025 competitive season, which captures comprehensive in-game information across professional matches played in the LOL 2025 season.

This dataset compiles data from over 40 different competitive leagues worldwide, comprising of over 118932 rows and 164 distinct columns. It captures a wide range of in-game statistics and match outcomes from professional League of Legends matches, including objectives, combat performance, vision metrics, economy statistics, and overall results. The scale and depth of this dataset make it well suited for analyzing player behaviors, team strategy, gameplay trends, overall dynamics, and so much more.

In the context of League of Legends, objectives play a central role in shaping the flow and outcome of a match. Objectives are neutral map features that teams can contest and secure to gain strategic advantages. These include epic monsters such as Dragons, Rift Heralds, Void Grubs, Barons, and Elder Dragons, as well as structural objectives like towers, turret plates, and inhibitors. Each objective provides lasting buffs, map pressure, or economic advantages that directly influence a team’s ability to control the game.

Beyond immediate rewards, objectives determine a team’s tempo and win conditions. Securing early objectives can establish momentum and map control, while late-game objectives such as Baron and Elder Dragon often serve as decisive turning points that enable teams to close out matches because of the buffs and tempo they give. Objectives impact vision control, gold distribution, overall strength, and so much more within the game. 

The question I am interested in is:

** How does objective control influence a team’s chances of winning a League of Legends match? ** 

In this project, we will analyze professional League of Legends match data using several techniques to find the impact of objectives on match outcomes. Through exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing, and predictive modeling, we examine how securing objectives such as Dragons, Heralds, Barons, and structural objectives impact a team’s chance of winning.
